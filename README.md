     example: "eerie-spam:0.2;nbd-spam:0.8" means eerie-spam is the defense deck 20% of the time, while nbd-spam is the defense deck 80% of
the time.
  2) a regular expression surrounded by /.
     regular expression will be used to search all custom decks for matching keys.
     example: "/^GT/" will select all custom decks starting with the letters GT.

Flags:
  yfort &lt;your_fortress_cards&gt;: your fortress structures. your_fortress_cards: the name/hash/cards of one or two fortress structures.

  -e &lt;effect&gt;: set the battleground effect.
               use "tu_optimize Po Po -e list" to get a list of all available effects.
  -r: the attack deck is played in order instead of randomly (respects the 3 cards drawn limit).
  -s: use surge (default is fight).
  -t &lt;num&gt;: set the number of threads, default is 4.
  -turnlimit &lt;num&gt;: set the number of turns in a battle, default is 50.
  win:     simulate/optimize for win rate. [default].
  defense: simulate/optimize for win rate + stall rate. can be used for defending deck.
Flags for climb:
  -c: don't try to optimize the commander.
  -L &lt;min&gt; &lt;max&gt;: restrict deck size between &lt;min&gt; and &lt;max&gt;.
  -o: restrict to the owned cards listed in "data/ownedcards.txt".
  -o=&lt;filename&gt;: restrict to the owned cards listed in &lt;filename&gt;.
  target &lt;num&gt;: stop as soon as the score reaches &lt;num&gt;.

Operations:
  sim &lt;num&gt;: simulate &lt;num&gt; battles to evaluate a deck.
  climb &lt;num&gt;: perform hill-climbing starting from the given attack deck, using up to &lt;num&gt; battles to evaluate a deck.
